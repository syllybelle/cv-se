## Personal note
I am a medical researcher looking for a research/data science/clinical position in Sweden and Norway. I have extensive clinical 
experience through a 6-year medical degree, with additional wet- and dry-lab research experience through a 1-year honours course 
and extracurricular projects. Through a desire to learn more powerful statistical tools relevent to the complex and 
multidimensional nature of medicine and physiology, I have been working as a data scientist for health 
analytics startup [WIMMY (Pty) Ltd](https://wimmy.co.za/). This position has additionally given me exposure to the role of 
enterprise in medicine, and experience with a wide array of software development systems and computer science concepts.

I enjoy scoping and mapping out complex problems and projects so that meaningful, clear insights can be derived. I am always 
willing to explore new skills and concepts in order to meet technical or scientific standards, driven by a deep investment in 
the veracity and quality of output, on personal and team levels. I have a particular research interest in the pathophysiology of 
neuropsychiatric disorders, and my ideal research project would involve re-examining psychiatric biomarkers in an 
undifferentiated/undiagnosed cohort of presenting patients, to see if new insights about brain function and dysfunction can be 
derived when the potentially confounding impact of syndromic diagnosis is removed.
