### Research and Publications
B(Med)Sc Hons (“UCT intercalated honours programme”) (2017-2020):
- exposure to most biomedical wet-lab techniques in a 6 week techniques course. 
- original experimental research
- explored brain changes that might explain previously observed behaviour changes in a peritoneal Taenia crassiceps infection in mice.
- Techniques: western blots (expert), cytokine arrays (novice), immunohistochemistry (novice)
- 5 month project as sole investigator with my PI, requiring a dissertation containing a literature review, result collection and data analysis and a formal oral presentation.
- continued working on the project concurrently with my medical studies, with ELISA findings from a second investigator to explore an incidental finding of increased IgG in the hippocampi of mice with a peritoneal T. crassiceps infection.
- publication based off findings:
		Van Belle S, de Lange A, Tomes H, Lucas R, Naidoo V, Raimondo JV. Peripheral Taenia infection increases immunoglobulins in the central nervous system. Int J Parasitol. 2021 Mar 20:S0020-7519(21)00095-3. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpara.2020.12.008. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33753094.
“Special studies module” (2015-2017):
- qualitative survey and systems requirements analysis
- project was initiated as a 4 week “special studies module” part of the MBChB curriculum to “expose” medical students to research. 
- I formed my own research question, aiming to explore the viability of an mHealth and eHealth solution that would bridge the gap between health care providers and health care users in the South Africa.
- the research involved a literature review, conducted semi-structured interviews, a thematic analysis of the interviews and proposing a design for future mHealth solutions.
- wrote a dissertation based on initial findings for my class report, and then continued the project for another 18 months, presenting my finalised work as the primary investigator at the 2017 ACIST conference
